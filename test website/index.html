      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
          Allow me to introduce myself: I am a senior at the University of Michigan, 
          currently receiving a Bachelor in Information Science from School of Information 
          and a minor from the Ross School of Business. I have always had an analytical mind 
          and excelled in classes that challenged me to use my problem-solving skills through 
          careful and thoughtful evaluation techniques. I am a highly organized and detail-oriented 
          individual seeking a full-time job in a related field.â€‹

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>
          During my freetime, I enjoy spending time with my friends, cooking, playing sports, running, and travelling. 
          Ever since I was 5 years old, I loved playing ice hockey and lacrosse. I travelled all across the world to play hockey. 
          I played in Prague, Italy, Israel, and Canada. I played varsity lacrosse all throughout High School. Check out one of the websites I 
          designed for school about food <a href="file:///Users/ellieheller/Dropbox/University%20of%20Michigan/Junior/SI%20339/final-project-recipes/aboutme.html" target="_blank">here</a>!

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>Throughout my years of college, I have had three great internships that have allowed me to gain industry experience.
          After my Freshman year, I interned for The NRP Group as a Property Management Intern. After my Sophmore year, I 
          interned for Delicious Israel in Tel Aviv as a Marketing Social Media Analyst. And this past year, I interned for KPMG as 
          a Data Analytics & AI Advisory Intern in the Digital Lighthouse practice.
